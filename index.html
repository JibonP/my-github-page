    <h2>What is GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is a web-based version control and collaboration platform for
      software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub,
      acquired the platform for $7.5 billion in 2018. GitHub, which is delivered
      through a software as a service (SaaS) business model, was started in
      2008. It was founded on Git, an open source code management system created
      by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.

    <h2>How does GitHub work?</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a hosting service and web
      interface for the Git code repository, as well as management tools for
      collaboration. The developer platform can be thought of as a social
      networking site for software developers. Members can follow each other,
      rate each other's work, receive updates for specific open source projects,
      and communicate publicly or privately.
